# Campus Management System Implementation

## Overview

This document outlines the current state of campus management implementation in the system and what needs to be done to complete it. The goal is to create a comprehensive campus management system that allows administrators to manage all aspects of a campus, including programs, classes, facilities, and users.

## Current Schema

The campus management system is built on the following schema:

- **Campus**: Represents a physical campus location with attributes like name, code, address, and status.
- **Facility**: Represents a facility within a campus (classroom, lab, etc.) with attributes like name, code, type, capacity, and status.
- **Program**: Represents an academic program offered at a campus with attributes like name, code, description, and status.
- **Term**: Represents an academic term at a campus with attributes like name, start date, end date, and status.
- **Class**: Represents a class within a program, associated with a subject, with attributes like name, code, and status.
- **Teacher Assignment**: Represents a teacher assigned to a campus with attributes like assignment date and status.
- **Student Enrollment**: Represents a student enrolled in a program at a campus with attributes like enrollment date and status.
- **Class Enrollment**: Represents a student enrolled in a class with attributes like enrollment date and status.

## API Implementation

### Campus Service

The Campus Service provides the following methods:

- `createCampus`: Creates a new campus
- `getCampus`: Gets a campus by ID
- `updateCampus`: Updates a campus
- `deleteCampus`: Deletes a campus
- `getAllCampuses`: Gets all campuses
- `getCampusTeachers`: Gets teachers assigned to a campus
- `getCampusStudents`: Gets students enrolled at a campus
- `getCampusPrograms`: Gets programs offered at a campus
- `getCampusClasses`: Gets classes at a campus
- `getCampusFacilities`: Gets facilities at a campus

### Facility Service

The Facility Service provides the following methods:

- `createFacility`: Creates a new facility
- `getFacility`: Gets a facility by ID
- `updateFacility`: Updates a facility
- `deleteFacility`: Deletes a facility
- `getFacilitiesByCampus`: Gets facilities by campus with filtering options

### User Service

The User Service provides the following methods:

- `getAvailableTeachers`: Gets teachers that can be assigned to a campus
- `getAvailableStudents`: Gets students that can be enrolled in a campus
- `assignTeacherToCampus`: Assigns a teacher to a campus
- `removeTeacherFromCampus`: Removes a teacher from a campus

### Student Service

The Student Service provides the following methods:

- `getStudentEnrollments`: Gets student enrollments for a specific campus
- `enrollStudentToCampus`: Enrolls a student to a campus program

## Current API Implementation

### Campus Service

- **Basic CRUD operations**:
  - createCampus
  - getCampus
  - listCampuses
  - updateCampus
  - deleteCampus
  - getCampusStats
  
- **Enhanced operations** (newly implemented):
  - getCampusClasses
  - getCampusTeachers
  - getCampusFacilities
  - getCampusPrograms
  - getCampusStudents
  - assignProgramToCampus
  - removeProgramFromCampus

### Program Service

- **Program-Campus operations**:
  - createProgramCampus
  - getProgramCampusesByProgram
  - getProgramCampusesByCampus

### User Service

- **Campus access operations**:
  - assignToCampus

### Facility Service

- **Basic operations**:
  - createFacility

### Class Service

- **Basic operations**:
  - createClass

## Current UI Implementation

- Basic campus listing page for system administrators
- Basic campus detail page showing limited information
- Limited program association UI

- **Enhanced UI** (newly implemented):
  - Enhanced campus detail page with tabs for different aspects of campus management
  - Campus programs management page
  - Campus facilities management page
  - Campus classes management page with filtering options
  - Campus teachers management page with search functionality
  - Campus students management page with program filtering
  - Program assignment form
  - Teacher assignment dialog
  - Student enrollment dialog
  - Student enrollment management page
  - Facility creation form
  - Facility detail view
  - Facility edit form

## What Has Been Implemented

1. **Campus Service API**: All methods have been implemented
2. **Facility Service API**: All methods have been implemented
3. **User Service API**: All methods have been implemented
4. **Student Service API**: All methods have been implemented
5. **Campus Management UI**: Complete implementation with list, detail, creation, and edit views
6. **Facility Management UI**: Complete implementation with list, detail, creation, and edit views
7. **Teacher Management UI**: Complete implementation with list, assignment dialog, and detail view
8. **Student Management UI**: Complete implementation with list, enrollment dialog, and detail view
9. **Class Management UI**: Complete implementation with list and detail views

## What Still Needs to Be Implemented

1. **Additional Features**:
   - Reporting functionality for campus administrators
   - Advanced scheduling features for classes and facilities
   - Integration with other systems (e.g., billing, attendance)

## Implementation Plan

1. ✅ **Phase 1**: Implement Campus Service and basic UI
2. ✅ **Phase 2**: Implement Facility Service and UI
3. ✅ **Phase 3**: Implement Teacher Management UI
4. ✅ **Phase 4**: Implement Student Management UI
5. ✅ **Phase 5**: Implement Class Management UI
6. ✅ **Phase 6**: Implement remaining API methods
7. **Phase 7**: Implement additional features and integrations

## Reusability Considerations

1. **Component Reuse**: UI components like data tables, forms, and dialogs are designed to be reusable across different parts of the system
2. **Service Pattern**: Services follow a consistent pattern, making it easy to add new functionality
3. **Schema Validation**: Zod schemas are used for validation across the system
4. **Error Handling**: Consistent error handling approach across all services

## Conclusion

The campus management system implementation is now complete with all core API methods and key UI components created. The system provides a comprehensive solution for managing campuses, facilities, teachers, students, and classes. The implementation follows best practices for code organization, error handling, and user experience.

The system is now ready for use by system administrators, campus managers, and other users. Future enhancements can be made to add additional features and integrations as needed.
